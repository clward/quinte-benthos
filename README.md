# quinte-benthos

This repository contains R code to extract and compile raw data for benthic invertebrates collected from the Bay of Quinte (Ontario, Canada). Collections were conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada at four sites from 1967 to 2011.  
  
The script creates a dataframe ("benthos") with the following columns:  
**taxGroup**: taxonomic groupings as selected by Ron Dermott (formerly of Fisheries and Oceans Canada GLLFAS)  
**meanAbundAerial**: individuals / m^2  
**meanBiomassAerial_shellFree**: shell-free biomass (mg Wet Wt / m^2)  
The data represent annual means of 4-5 replicate samples collected on one day each year (generally in August)  
  
Inquiries about accessing raw data should be directed to Warren Currie (warren.currie - at - dfo-mpo.gc.ca) or Marten Koops (marten.koops - at - dfo-mpo.gc.ca) at Fisheries and Oceans Canada.
